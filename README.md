# Mini-Solar-Tracker

This project was designed and built as a part of our first year college coursework for the course "Energy and Environment". The aim was to build a prototype of a single-axis solar
tracker.
Details:
1. Single axis solar tracker.
2. Measures the difference in the outputs of Light Dependent Resistors placed on each side of the tracker and orients in accordingly.
3. Uses REES52 Futaba S3003 Servo Motor with Arduino Uno as MCU
